Linear search (Brute force)
Binary search (if no word at mid, we have to go two sides, when we find a word we can compare and move on that side. And in the worst case scenario, it will be still O(n)
Tries: would be the better option
If we have to do it again and again, Tries would be the better option. Still be O(n) but trie would be the better solution if we have to perform it again and again
